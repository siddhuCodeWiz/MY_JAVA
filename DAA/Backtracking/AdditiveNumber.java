/*An additive number is a string whose digits can form an additive sequence.

A valid additive sequence should contain at least three numbers. 
Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits, return true if it is an additive number or false otherwise.

Note: Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros, so sequence 1, 2, 03 or 1, 02, 3 is invalid.

Input Format:
--------------
Line-1: An integer

Output Format:
--------------
Line-1: A boolean value
Sample Input-1:
---------------
112358

Sample Output-1:
---------------
true

Explanation: 
The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8


Sample Input-2:
---------------
199100199

Sample Output-2:
---------------
true

Explanation: 
The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199. 
1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199
 
Sample Input-3:
---------------
789

Sample Output-3:
---------------
false


Constraints:
------------
1 <= num.length <= 35, num consists only of digits
Time complexity: O(N^2)
Space complexity: O(1) */
